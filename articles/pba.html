<h1>Pipe Brute-force Attack via Password Generator [crunch <3 hashcat]</h1>
</header>
  
<section class="container">
  <p><strong>Efficient and resource saving trick that was there for decades.</strong></p>

<p>
  During password cracking you might decide to brute force a target hash,any service or online website, for that you may need/create heavy dictionaries which can take terabytes of data. But we can skip that step and feed the password directly from generator to brute-force automation software.
</p>
<h3>How much an eight digit long numeric password take on disk?</h3>
<p>Let’s have a look on most basic and may-be-doesn’t-even-happen-today kind of scenario, creating a 8 digit numerical password with crunch.</p>
<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/818/1*G9AhPXlIYWLwoJkFD-z6GA.png">
<p>858 MB for 8 digit numeric? not too big right, with our 1–2TBs of hard-drives it will do no harm to us.
<br>
  let’s come to real-life condition now, step-by-step …
  <br>
  8 letter lowercase alphabets ? …</p>
<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/819/1*HKpP62dqfxk7o_V1W78uYA.png">
<p>1 TB ! just for our new word-list, and to be honest I am writing this from my PC with total storage of 1TB … if i remove all the files and OSes then i may store it, but again i need OS to perform attacks ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.</p>

<p>and this is last one fulfilling all the basic NEEDS OF MODERN WEBSITES.
<ul>
  <li>1. At least one UPPERCASE</li>
  <li>2. Use of NUMBERS</li>
  <li>3. LOWERCASE</li>
  <li>4. Special charset</li>
  <li>5. Alien species’s language and what ever your PC allows you to throw at login filed!</li>
  
</ul></p>
<p><strong>CHAR-SET = 0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ!”#$%&’()*+,-./:;\<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~</strong><br>Yeah, we left Alien language this time.</p>
<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1026/1*osEbNjaduUT5-BYTm0FvVQ.png">
<p>now unless you own a data storage farm to store 54303 TB of data, that would be ~ 27150 common 2TB storage drives, so let’s get over this problem by ‘piping’ the output directly to software rather than storing it in the device itself.</p>
<h3>How to overcome this limitation?</h3>
<p>Suppose we want to crack the hash of password <strong>‘17652986’</strong> now md5 of this hash <strong>ce5cff0195a6b059a3241c1b6202ab49</strong>
 now we can either create a file of 8 digits numbers or can just pass the list from crunch directly to hashcat
 <br> <strong>$ crunch 8 8 123456789| hashcat -m 0 ce5cff0195a6b059a32411b6202ab49</strong>
  <br>
  notice the ‘|’ in the command? this is called <strong>‘pipe’</strong> it will change the standard output of the crunch command to to hashcat and the hashcat when supplied no word-lists, listens on standard input.

<p>Flow of data from buffer to brute-force program directly (left figure) — (1)<br>

  Flow of data to hard-disk and then to the program (right figure) — (2)<br>
  
  Here we can already see (1) is much faster and efficient in practice as it does not interact with the hard-disk at all.</p>

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1387/1*SUUvuNKweFdpjLSMVaabcg.png">
<p>and you can see it took just 31 seconds to crack 8 digit numeric password !(highlighted), but that’s predictable and speed here was not our concern.
